# Task Manager App: Learn React's useReducer Hook

This project is a simple task manager application built with React. It demonstrates how to use the useReducer hook to manage complex state in a React component. The useReducer hook is an alternative to the useState hook and is particularly useful when dealing with state that has multiple sub-values or when the state logic involves complex updates.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the task list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Filter tasks based on completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete)
- Persist tasks in the browser's local storage
